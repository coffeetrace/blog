###### For the first time, Tribal Growers in the remote districts of Karnataka sold Geo-Tagged Coffee with **CoffeeTrace**.

Presently, every stakeholder within the supply network maintains their own databases and systems, it becomes difficult to perform predictive monitoring and know what was done at different stages of the production.

While food fraud is not new, the Current food safety management systems are designed to control one’s own organisation with limited ways to control, monitor or mitigate frauds at other stages of the supply chain.

Current ERP systems are designed for visibility of only one step back and one step forward (Supplier & Buyer) in the supply chain, making it impossible to identify the defaulter in case of a fraud or counterfeiting.

Beyond one kind of bean being subbed for another, [a 2014 report from the National Chemical Society](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-08/acs-kci070814.php) found that ground coffee could contain all sorts of filler ingredients, from barley to wheat. (Scientists have [developed high-tech methods of testing for that](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030881461530323X) too, and it involves DNA testing.) While it’s not currently known just how widespread coffee fraud is — or isn’t — it’s a problem that only seems destined to get worse going forward: The global demand for the precious caffeinated beverage is rising (see: [Starbucks’ major push into emerging coffee market China](http://www.eater.com/2016/1/12/10754112/starbucks-china-expansion-2500-stores)) and climate change is taking a toll on production, leading to speculation that [a global coffee shortage](http://www.eater.com/2015/10/1/9437041/coffee-shortage-worldwide) could be coming.

Think of the Coffee Trace Blockchain as an _immutable ledger that no counterfeiter, hacker or forger can ever change_. Once a bag of coffee has been proven to be authentic and its provenance certified to be correct, that information is added to the Coffee Trace blockchain. Any time a buyer or seller would like to authenticate, all he or she has to do is check the information stored on Coffee Trace Blockchain. This information technology is of immense interest to any coffee industry participants — such as auction houses, private collectors, retailers, or hospitality venues — that absolutely need to be assured of the quality and authenticity of the coffee they are offering.
